🦺 PPE Detection using YOLOv8
This project uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once v8) to detect Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as helmets and safety vests in images. The goal is to leverage deep learning for real-time safety monitoring in industrial and construction environments.

📌 Project Overview
✅ Used YOLOv8 for object detection

✅ Trained on a pre-labeled dataset of PPE images

✅ Detected multiple PPE classes like helmet and vest

✅ Evaluated using Precision, Recall, and mAP

✅ Visualized detection results with bounding boxes

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.x

YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

Google Colab (for training)

🧪 Dataset
Used a publicly available pre-labeled PPE dataset with bounding boxes.

Dataset included images of people wearing:

🪖 Helmets

🦺 Safety vests
